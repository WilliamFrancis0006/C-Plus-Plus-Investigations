# C++-Investigations

Programing Languages Assignment: covers three investigations in C++

# Investigation 1 Goto

Can the goto statement be utilized in C++? If so, what do you go to? Show coded examples
and output.

# Investigation 2 Blocks

Can separate blocks be specied in C++, and if so, how is variable scoping handled? Show
coded examples and output.

# Investigation 3 Arrays

Typically, arrays are passed by reference in programming languages since they can be arbi-
trarily long and copying each element may take time and space. How are arrays passed to
functions in C++? If by reference, is there a way to pass them by value? If so, how? Show
coded examples and output.
